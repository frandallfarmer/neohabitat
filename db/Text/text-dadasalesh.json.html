        A Note from Dada Salesh         
                                        
I am the Powerful Wizard 'Salesh'!      
(Really, I am!) I will pay the sum of   
XYZ Tokens to the first Avatar or team  
to find my Amulet and return it to me.  
                                        
The following informaton about theives/ 
scumm that I 'ported back to my house   
(with my WONDROUS powers) may be helpful
to you:                                 
1) They had a map of D'nalsi Island with
them. (I have taken the liberty of      
making copies of the map for you,       
available for a small fee...)

2) As I snatched the map away, the      
uglier of the two said, 'You'll never   
find it! HA! HA! HA!' and flashed a sign
of some sort: he formed a triangle with 
the thumbs and index fingers of each    
hand, palms forward.                    
    The only advice I can think of to   
get you on your way is this: there is no
form of water transportation in the     
world, so they must have 'ported to the 
island.                                 
Equip well & Good Luck.                 
Dada Salesh, big bucks wizard for hire.
