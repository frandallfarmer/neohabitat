           Capture the Flag             
                                        
The Capture the Flag area was discovered
in a backup of Populopolis circa 1987/8.
                                        
It was originally located where Fine    
Furniture is now in downtown.           
                                        
The game never made it past the initial 
planning stages. These regions are all  
that remain of the game. As well as some
supporting documentation in the Habitat 
archives.

           Capture the Flag             
                                        
Only Field #3 was completed and is      
accessible. It's likely that this was to
be used for initial testing before      
completing work on the other arenas.    
                                        
The game was fairly well planned out,   
however it required some server side    
changes to be implemented to support    
gameplay. It was at this point that     
progress on the game halted.
