       HOW TO USE THE TELEPORTER        
                                        
Using a teleporter requires tokens, so  
you must first GET tokens out of your   
pocket and then place your cursor on the
teleporter. While your cursor is still  
on the elevator perform a PUT command.  
Upon inserting a token you should hear  
a brief sound indicating success. Make  
sure your avatar is inside the teleport 
and that your cursor is placed on the   
teleporter itself. Now, type in '42nd'  
or 'plaza' and press RETURN. Typing in  
'home' will also take you to your       
own private turf.
