		"     Teleports are usually addressed by " +
        "the streets or intersections at which   " +
		"the booths are placed.                  " +

		"     A booth at the mid-point of a      " +
		"residential street will generally be    " +
		"named after that street, while booths at" +
		"the ends of streets are usually named by" +
		"the street name and together with the   " +
		"direction from the mid-point to that    " +
		"end.  For example, the teleport at the  " +
		"center of Baker St. is \"Baker St\", while" +

		"the 'ports at either end of this street " +
		"are \"Baker St East\" and \"Baker St West\" " +
		"respectively.  Streets that run         " +
		"north-south would have correspondingly  " +
		"named booths at their ends.             " +
		"                                        " +
		"     Teleport addresses also contain    " +
		"area codes that indicate the city or    " +
		"zone in which the booths reside.  The   " +
		"area code is separated from the rest of " +
		"the address by a \"-\" character.  The    " +
		"area code for Populopolis is \"Pop\", so  " +

		"a long-distance 'port to another city   " +

		"it.  Hold a token of denomination $10 or" +

		"with your cursor, and choose the PUT    " +
		"command.  The booth will indicate that  " +
