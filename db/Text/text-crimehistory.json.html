    The History of Organized Crime in   
              in Habitat                
                                        
Organized crime has never really been a 
big problem in Habitat. There is only   
one major gang, and it is now almost    
extinct. If it has a name, none of its  
members have ever spoken it publicly.   
The only way they can identify each     
other is by some secret hand signal. The
Mob (as they are colloquially known) was
formed by a small number of Avatars bent
on self destruction. All but a few      
members have been caught, (easily) tried
, and sent into the void. Their crimes  
are nearly always mis-handled or bungled

in some major way. One good example of  
their foolhardiness is reflected in     
their security control: they have       
consistently used only 2 style of locks 
& keys, styles #2000 and #4747. As is   
widely known, these are the two most    
common locks in the known world. You can
see why they would have financial       
problems...
