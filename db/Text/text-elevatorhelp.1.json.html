        HOW TO USE THE ELEVATOR         
                                        
The elevator works a lot like the       
teleporter. Place your cursor over the  
elevator and perform a GO command. The  
placement of your avatar inside the     
elevator is important. Make sure your   
cursor is still located on the elevator.
Type in the floor number that you wish  
to go to and press RETURN. If you want  
to go to the 4th floor then type in the 
number '4' and press RETURN. To go back 
to the lobby with the elevator, just    
type in 'lobby' and you'll be sent back 
.
