		"History of Teleport:                     The teleport was invented by the great tinkerer avatar Foontrafian Subtrax. It took many years to perfect the          technique, and many a test animal was   lost to the void. It is still rumored   to this day that, when the conditions   are JUST RIGHT when teleporting, an     avatar may end up with animal parts in  place of his normal limbs and/or head.  Rest assured that this is ONLY a rumor. Reguardless of the rumored risks, the   teleport has become the single most     valued addition to the universe,        opening whole vista's of places to      explore. THANK YOU Foontrafian!

		"  How a Port address is chosen:                                                 Most often, all teleport booths are     registered in the Teleport-Book,        published in every major city. There    are some standards loosely adhered to   when generating a port address:                                                 Where         Style                     ------------  ---------------           Streets       City-Streetname           Intersection  City-Streetname Cross     Downtown      City-'Downtown'/'Plaza'   Forests       Nickname                  Islands       Ilename                   Deserts       Why would you care?!

People have been known to spend large   amounts of money to buy personal        booths and NOT register them. These     booths usually have customized          addresses that have personal meaning    to the owner (so the address is not     forgotten)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              "
