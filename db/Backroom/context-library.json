				+ "Welcome to Habitat!  We're sure you're  "
				+ "going to have a terrific time!  This is "
				+ "the very first edition of the 'Weekly   "
				+ "Rant', the Habitat newspaper.  The Rant "
				+ "is your official source for the most    "
				+ "up-to-date news and information about   "
				+ "the Habitat world.  Here you will find  "
				+ "the latest pronouncements from the      "
				+ "Oracle, notices of important changes to "
				+ "the world as they happen, and a timely  "
				+ "accounting of the Avatars and events    "
				+ "that shape our lives.",

				+ "                                        "
				+ "Congratulations!  You're one of the     "
				+ "Habitat pioneers.  When you get done    "
				+ "wandering around your Turf, picking     "
				+ "things up and putting them away again,  "
				+ "changing the color of your furniture,   "
				+ "fiddling with the lights, and generally "
				+ "learning how things work, you're        "
				+ "probably going to ask yourself, 'So,    "
				+ "what do I do here?'                     "
				+ "                                        "
				+ "A good way to start getting yourself    "
				+ "oriented is to learn how to use the     "
				+ "TelePort network.  In order to TelePort "
				+ "you'll need cash, so you'll have to find",

				"a Bank and learn to use the Automatic   "
				+ "Token Machine.  To find a Bank you'll   "
				+ "need to find the business district,     "
				+ "which'll get you out exploring the      "
				+ "world.  Be sure to take note of your    "
				+ "street address the first time you step  "
				+ "out front of your house -- you'll want  "
				+ "to be able to find your way back!  Visit"
				+ "the shops downtown.  Head on down to the"
				+ "Oracle and see who's hanging out.  Be   "
				+ "friendly!  And keep your eye out for    "
				+ "clues.  Even though the world is just   "
				+ "getting started, there's already a few  "
				+ "adventures awaiting you!",

				+ "'Great Amulet Caper' were found guilty  "
				+ "of Grand Theft Magic, and sentenced to 5"
				+ "years in The Void.  In pronouncing the  "
				+ "sentence to a hushed, packed courtroom, "
				+ "Judge Themonioli was solemn.  'Zap'em   "

				+ "Oracle sort'em out!  Next case!'        "

				+ "The story began last week when the Great"
				+ "Amulet of Wonderous Worth was stolen    "
				+ "from the Back-Forty home of Habitat's   "
				+ "resident Not-So-Wise-Man, Dada Salesh.",

				"Salesh, a powerful but clumsy wizard,   "
				+ "tried to retrieve the valuable trinket  "
				+ "with a homing-return spell, but his     "
				+ "attempt backfired.  Instead of          "
				+ "recovering the stolen property, Salesh  "
				+ "accidentally Ported the thieves         "
				+ "themselves to his house.  Although this "
				+ "resulted in the thieves' immediate      "
				+ "capture, the Amulet is still missing.   "
				+ "                                        "
				+ "All attempts by officials to extract    "
				+ "information from the evil-doers have    "
				+ "been in vain.  It is feared that the    "
				+ "Amulet may remain forever lost.",
