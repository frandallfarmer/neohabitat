Habibots
========

The [Neohabitat Project](http://neohabitat.org) has recently resurrected the world's first
graphical MMO, [Lucasfilm's Habitat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_(video_game)).
As we developed it, we found ourselves writing a bunch of in-world bots to test features,
and we've packaged up most of the useful bits into this framework, which you can use to
rapidly develop bots of your own.
