Getting Started
===============

We're rebuilding the world's first MMO, brick by brick, and we're over the moon
to have you on board. We wanted to make it fast and easy to get started, and in
our experience you can go from nothing to a fully-functional development
environment in under 20 minutes. Simply follow this guide and you'll be on your
way to contributor status before you know it.

Overview
--------

There are five services that must be established to run Neohabitat:

-   Neohabitat server (based on [Elko](https://github.com/FUDCo/Elko))

-   Neohabitat-to-Habitat protocol bridge (converts Neohabitat messages into
    binary packets compatible with the QuantumLink protocol)

-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (to persist Neohabitat data)

-   [QuantumLink Reloaded server](https://github.com/ssalevan/qlink)
    (reconstructs the original 1980s
    [QuantumLink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Link) service, proxying
    Habitat packets to Commodore 64 clients)

-   [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (to persist QuantumLink Reloaded data)

To expedite the setup procedure, we've created a [Docker
Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) setup script which will setup these
services and provide for swift iteration.

Step 1 - Install Docker or Vagrant
----------------------------------

To take advantage of the Neohabitat automation, you'll need to install either
**Docker and Docker Compose** or **Vagrant**. You can do so by following one of
the following guides:

**Windows**

If you're currently running **Windows 10 Professional/Enterprise/Education**,
you can use Docker for Windows, which will streamline the setup experience:

-   [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)

If so, follow the **Docker variant** of Step 2.

If you're not running one of these Windows versions, you can use the Vagrant
setup procedure, which will work on all others **(7/8/10 Home)**. Download and
install the **latest versions** of the following programs:

-   [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

-   [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Next, follow the **Vagrant variant** of Step 2.

**OS X**

Follow the instructions here:

-   [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)

Next, follow the **Docker variant** of Step 2.

**Linux**

Follow the instructions here:

-   [Docker for
    Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/)

-   [Docker for
    CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/centos/)

-   [Docker for
    Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/fedora/)

Next, follow the **Docker variant** of Step 2.

Step 2 - Build and Start Neohabitat Services (with Docker)
----------------------------------------------------------

Now that you've installed Docker, you can trigger the Neohabitat launch process
with a single command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
docker-compose up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Docker Compose will proceed to pull the images for all dependent services then
launch the Neohabitat build process. This will take approximately 10 minutes
upon the first build; all subsequent launches will be near-instantaneous. You'll
see the following log output when this process has completed:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
qlink_1       | 2017-01-14 08:47:49,035 [main] INFO  org.jbrain.qlink.QLinkServer  - Starting server
qlink_1       | 2017-01-14 08:47:49,065 [main] INFO  org.jbrain.qlink.QLinkServer  - Listening on 0.0.0.0:5190

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Docker Compose will proxy the following service ports to localhost:

-   **1337**: Habitat protocol bridge

-   **3307**: MariaDB (open source MySQL) server

-   **5190**: QuantumLink Reloaded server

-   **9000**: Neoclassical Habitat Elko server

-   **27017**: MongoDB server

The Neohabitat repository will be linked into the /neohabitat directory of the
'neohabitat' container. You can get to a Bash console on this container (based
on EL7) by running the following command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
docker-compose exec neohabitat /bin/bash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to restart the Neohabitat server after making a code change, be
certain that you've built a new JAR locally via the `./build` command then
restart Neohabitat with the following command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
docker-compose restart neohabitat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Step 2 - Build and Start Neohabitat Services (with Vagrant)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Open a **standard Windows command line (cmd.exe, not Bash or PowerShell)** and
navigate via `cd` to the location of your Neohabitat checkout. Run the following
command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
vagrant up --provider=virtualbox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vagrant will proceed to download the Ubuntu image, launch it, install all
supporting services, then build Neohabitat and QuantumLink Reloaded.

After the build procedure has concluded, you can develop and build new artifacts
on your local machine and they will be synced through to Vagrant. Furthermore,
the following service ports will be forwarded to your local environment:

-   **1337**: Habitat protocol bridge

-   **3307**: MariaDB (open source MySQL) server

-   **5190**: QuantumLink Reloaded server

-   **9000**: Neoclassical Habitat Elko server

-   **27017**: MongoDB server

You can reach a console via the following command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
vagrant ssh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to restart the Neohabitat server after making a code change, be
certain that you've built a new JAR locally via the `./build` command then
restart Neohabitat with the following command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
vagrant reload
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method **will not use Docker whatsoever**.

**Troubleshooting**

If all does not go well during the Vagrant provisioning step, it's likely that
either Vagrant can't find VirtualBox or one of the upstream Linux package
repositories is having issues.

If Vagrant returns an error like so:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No usable default provider could be found for your system.

Vagrant relies on interactions with 3rd party systems, known as
"providers", to provide Vagrant with resources to run development
environments. Examples are VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V.

If so, you may need to retry the Vagrant build process:

The easiest solution to this message is to install VirtualBox, which
is available for free on all major platforms.

If you believe you already have a provider available, make sure it
is properly installed and configured. You can see more details about
why a particular provider isn't working by forcing usage with
`vagrant up --provider=PROVIDER`, which should give you a more specific
error message for that particular provider.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may need to change the value of the `ENV["VBOX_INSTALL_PATH"]` setting in
your Vagrantfile to point to your custom VirtualBox installation.

If an error occurs during the provisioning process, simply retry the launch
procedure after waiting a few minutes:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
vagrant up --provider=virtualbox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Step 3 - Download and Configure Vice
------------------------------------

To test Commodore 64 behavior, you'll need to install a C64 emulator and
download the necessary client software. We strongly recommend using
[Vice](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/), as it has an active upstream and
allows you to connect its emulated serial ports to the stdin/stdout of an
external process.

**Windows**

Download the latest Windows Vice emulator from the above link then make the
following configuration changes:

-   Go to **Settings –\> RS232 Settings**:

-   Set **RS232 Device 1** to the following: **127.0.0.1:5190**

-   Go to **Settings –\> Cart I/O Settings –\> RS232 Userport settings**:

-   Enable **RS232 Userport** and **Userport Device RS232 Device 1**

-   Set **Userport baud rate** to the following: **1200**

### Controller Configuration

The Habitat client was designed to be controlled by a joystick. Using the
joystick, you move the cross-hair cursor around the screen to manipulate your
Avatar’s movements and actions. Since WinVice allows you to map keyboard keys to
joystick movements to simulate the device, a joystick is not required but it is
recommended. To configure a controller, follow the directions for the desired
type below.

**Keyboard (Joystick Emulation)**

-   Go to **Settings -\> Joystick Settings -\> (Check) Enable Joy Keys**

-   Go to **Settings -\> Joystick Settings -\> Joystick Settings**

-   Select the **Joystick \#1** drop-down and choose **Keyset A**

-   Select the **Configure Keyset A** button.

-   One button at a time, select the **South, West, East, North**, and **Fire**
    buttons; assigning a key to each button. If available it is suggested to use
    your numeric keypad buttons as to not interfere with typing text in the
    client.

-   Click **OK, OK**

**Joystick**

You can use a wired, wireless, or Bluetooth joystick which is PC compatible but
it must be plugged in prior to opening the WinVice client. If you have never
used the device on your current PC previously, you may need to run the
**Joystick Calibration Wizard** in the **Windows Control Panel** under **Devices
and Printers** before Vice will recognize the joystick.

Once your Joystick is plugged in and calibrated:

-   Open **WinVice**

-   Go to **Settings -\> Joystick Settings -\> Joystick Settings**

-   Select the **Joystick \#1** drop-down and choose your joystick from the list

    Note: If you do not see your joystick listed, select the **Calibrate
    Joystick** button and verify it is detected by Windows; then run the
    **Calibration Wizard** to ensure a profile is created for the joystick.
    After this is done, you may need to exit and re-launch WinVice.

**OS X**

Newer versions of Vice are not compatible with QuantumLink, so be sure to
download **version 2.4** of the **Cocoa UI variant**. Once you've done so, open
the DMG and follow this configuration procedure:

-   Drag the x64 application from the Vice D64 to your Applications folder

-   Establish a shell alias in your **\~/.bashrc** or **\~/.zshrc** to force the
    enabling of the RS232 userport:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
alias c64='/Applications/x64.app/Contents/MacOS/x64 -rsuser -rsuserbaud 1200 -rsuserdev 0'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Launch Vice via the above alias then go to **Settings -\> Resource
    Inspector**

-   Under **Peripherals -\> RS232**, set **Device 1** to the following: `|nc
    127.0.0.1 5190`

-   Under **Peripherals -\> RS232**, set **Device 1 Baud Rate** to the
    following: `1200`

-   Save these new settings via **Settings -\> Save current Settings**

Step 4 - Download the C64 Clients
---------------------------------

Client software can be downloaded here:

-   [QuantumLink (with Habitat
    support)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssalevan/neohabitat/QuantumLink.d64)

-   [Club Caribe disk A (a.k.a. side
    3)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssalevan/neohabitat/club-caribe-a.d64)

-   [Club Caribe disk B (a.k.a.
    Imagery)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssalevan/neohabitat/club-caribe-b.d64)

**NOTE:** Make a backup of QuantumLink.d64, as it gets modified with your
account information and a link to the Club Caribe game disk.

The **Club Caribe client software is identical to the Habitat software**, so
please note this as we continue.

Step 5 - Connect to QuantumLink Reloaded
----------------------------------------

Load the QuantumLink D64 image you just downloaded into Unit \#8 of your
emulated C64. You can do so via **File -\> Attach Disk Image -\> Unit \#8**.

After the QuantumLink disk is loaded, you can start it by running the following
C64 command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LOAD"*",8,1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eventually, you'll be brought to a screen that asks you to establish your
initial modem settings. You can use the arrow keys and enter to select each
configuration field; use the following settings:

-   Modem: **Other command driven modems**

-   Speed: **1200 Baud**

-   Dial: **Automatic**

-   Phone: **Tone**

-   Number: **+5551212**

After finishing this process, select **SIGN ON TO Q-LINK**. You'll be brought to
a green-framed screen which states `Type commands to the modem, then press F1
when connection is made.`:

![QuantumLink Connect Screen](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssalevan/neohabitat/connect_qlink.png)

Press **F1**, and if all goes well, your client will connect to QuantumLink
Reloaded and present you with a set of registration prompts. **Enter the
information prompted** and **remember your username**; you'll need it later.

When this task is complete, you'll be brought to the QuantumLink home screen;
it'll look something like this:

![QuantumLink Home Screen](http://toastytech.com/guis/c64gquantumlink.gif)

Step 6 - Load MongoDB Models
----------------------------

Recall the username you entered above then create a file in the **db/** folder
called **user-.json**. For instance, if your username was **Steve** ('steve' in
lowercase form), you'd add the following to **db/user-steve.json**:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ json
{
  "type": "user",
  "ref": "user-steve",
  "name": "Steve",
  "mods": [
    {
      "type": "Avatar",
      "x": 100,
      "y": 130,
      "bodyType": "male",
      "bankBalance": 2000,
      "custom": [68, 68],
      "nitty_bits": 8
    }
  ]
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please note that your username within the above "name" field **must also be
lowercase**.

After you've completed this step, you can load all models into MongoDB by
running the following commands from your Neohabitat checkout:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
cd db
make db
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You're now ready to start Habitat for the first time.

Step 7 - Launch Habitat
-----------------------

On the Commodore 64, the function keys were placed prominently to the right of
the main keyboard and were used heavily by many applications. As a result, much
of the navigation you'll use within QuantumLink will depend upon the usage of
function keys. These are the ones you'll use during your QuantumLink experience:

-   **F1** - Selects whatever is highlighted

-   **F3** - Saves whatever you're looking at to disk (you can likely ignore
    this one)

-   **F5** - Goes back, similar to the back button in a web browser

-   **F7** - Brings up a department menu

-   **Arrow Keys** - Moves the selector, whether in a menu or on the Home screen

At the QuantumLink home screen, ensure that the selector is placed over the
**People Connection** department then press **F1**. There will be a short load
period which will lead you to the People Connection screen:

![QuantumLink People Connection Screen](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssalevan/neohabitat/people_connection.png)

After reaching it, press **F7** to bring up the department menu. Select **Play
or observe an online game** with the **arrow keys** and press **F1**:

![QuantumLink People Connection Department Menu](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssalevan/neohabitat/department_menu.png)

Select **Start a game (pick your partners)** with the and press **F1** again.

Finally, select **Club Caribe** from the list and press **F1** one last time.

**NOTE:** If **Club Caribe** does NOT appear on the game list, you will first
need to patch the QuantumLink disk image.. - Start VINE booting to the Commodore
blue screen. - Mount the club-caribe-a.d64 disk image on drive 8 -
LOAD"ADDCARIBE",8,1 - When prompted, mount your registered QuantumLink.d64 image
on drive 8 and continue... - It takes quite awhile, but when you are done, you
can restart the Launch Habitat step.

You'll be asked to insert **Game Disk 3**, which is **Club Caribe Disk A
(club-caribe-a.d64)**. Attach this disk using the above procedure and hit
**Enter**. After doing so, you can engage Warp Mode to expedite the load
process.

Eventually, you'll reach a screen that looks something like this:

![QuantumLink Home Screen](http://vzn.eddcoates.com/clubcaribe/sitepics/ClubCarFront.gif)

You'll be asked to insert the **Imagery Disk**, which is **Club Caribe Disk B
(club-caribe-b.d64)**. Attach this disk using the above procedure and hit
**Enter**. You can engage Warp Mode here as well.

If all goes well, you'll be brought to the first Habitat screen:

![Habitat Start Screen](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssalevan/neohabitat/habitat_start.png)

If so, congratulations, you've just rebuilt Habitat!

Step 8 - Build Neohabitat Locally to Enable IDE Integration
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Neohabitat build scripting will install necessary dependency JARs that are
not present in Maven Central; to enable IDE support, simply run a local build:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
./build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After doing so, you'll be able to import the root pom.xml into Eclipse or
IntelliJ to gain full IDE integration.

You'll also want to run a local build when you've completed a code change and
are ready to reload Neohabitat.

Conclusion
----------

We hope that this guide helped you to get acquainted with Neohabitat and its
services and we're looking forward to working with you! If you have any
questions or concerns, feel free to ask them in the [Neohabitat
Slack](https://neohabitat.slack.com/).

Have fun and happy hacking!
