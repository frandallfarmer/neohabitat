Welcome!
========

You're about to connect to the world's first MMO, Lucasfilm's Habitat! There are thousands
of regions to explore and many awesome folks to meet from all around the world who come to
visit every day.

Logging In
----------

To get started, **hit any key** to get past the splash screen. Next, enter a name for your
new **Avatar**, such as **Threepwood**, **dril** or **Phil Collins**.

Flipping Disks
--------------

Press **Enter**, then wait for the Habitat client to load; this will run at the original
Commodore 64 speed, so be sure to give it a minute.

Next, Habitat will ask you to flip to the next disk. To do so on **PC**, press **Alt-N**.
To do so on **Mac**, press **Option-N**.

Once you've logged in, be sure to select your avatar name from the selector at the top of
the screen and select **Activate Docent**. This will activate Neohabitat's interactive web
experience, which will provide you with helpful guidance, dynamic help, and historical
background for much of the world.

Joystick
--------

Habitat's user interface is powered by a joystick, so we've set a default that should work
with the keyboard you're using:

| Joystick | Key               |
|----------|-------------------|
| Up       | Arrow Up          |
| Down     | Arrow Down        |
| Left     | Arrow Left        |
| Right    | Arrow Right       |
| Fire     | ~ key (above Tab) |

Have Fun!
---------

If you run into any issues during your travels throughout the world of Habitat, be sure to visit us on our [Slack](http://slack.neohabitat.org) and we'll be glad to lend a hand.

If you'd like to read this help document at any time, simply click the **Help** button in
the top bar of the user interface.

Otherwise, from all of us on the Neohabitat restoration team, we hope that you have a
great time and we'll see you in world!
